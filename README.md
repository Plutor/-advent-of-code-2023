I am doing [Advent of Code 2023](http://adventofcode.com/2022).
(I also did [2022](https://github.com/Plutor/advent-of-code-2022) and [2021](https://github.com/Plutor/advent-of-code-2021))

I am learning [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) from scratch. I am using vim on Linux.

# Learnings

* Yuppp, Scala's as fun as Kotlin.
* Like Haskell, `var`/`val` are too similar.
* `sbt` is pretty easy, but it's weird that it doesn't have a flag for project name with `sbt new` and I have to `cat |` the name into it.
* Also I kinda want to make my own skeleton that I can use with `sbt` but I haven't done that yet.

# Days of note

* Day 5 was the first really hard day, especially part 2. I implemented something that would take close to 3 days to finish, but didn't want to actually do that. I then spent time on the 6th trying to improve it instead of working on day 6, and then decided to jump straight to day 7. I still plan to go back and fill in these stars when I have the time.
